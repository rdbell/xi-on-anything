# Install FINAL FANTASY XI on this Mac. Paste into Terminal:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubymatrix/xi-on-mac/main/install.sh | bash
#
# Run the same line again to update: it fetches the newest sources and rebuilds what changed.
# Options go to tools/setup.py after `bash -s --`, e.g.
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --game ~/Games/"FINAL FANTASY XI"
#
# It gets Xcode's command line tools when they are missing (clang, git: a dialog from Apple, click
# Install), puts the sources in ~/Library/Application Support/FFXIRecompile/source, and runs
# tools/setup.py there: the game's code is translated and compiled on this Mac from the player's own
# game files, and "Final Fantasy XI.app" lands in /Applications.
#
# FFXI_SOURCE (folder), FFXI_REPO (git URL) and FFXI_BRANCH (default main) override where the sources
# go, where they come from and which branch.

# Everything is inside main, so a download cut short runs nothing.
